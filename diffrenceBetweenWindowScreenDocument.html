  <h1>Window</h1>
  <p>Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. Each &ltiframe&gt (and deprecated &rtframe&gt) element has its own window object too, nested within a parent window. 
  The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.
All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
Global variables are properties of the window object.
Global functions are methods of the window object.
Even the document object (of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object:</br>
window.document.getElementById("header");</br></br>
<strong>Some methods of window are as follow:</strong></br></br>
window.open() - open a new window</br>
window.close() - close the current window</br>
window.moveTo() - move the current window</br>
window.resizeTo() - resize the current window</br>
</p>
  <h1>Document</h1>
  <p>Each window object has a document object to be rendered. 
  These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the global object when assigned a unique id. 
  E.g., in the HTML snippet</br>
  &ltbody&gt </br>
  &ltp id="holyCow"&gt This is the first paragraph.&lt/p&gt </br>
&lt/body>&lt/p&gt </br>
  &lt/body&gt </br>
  the paragraph element can be referenced by any of the following:</br>

window.holyCow or window["holyCow"]</br>
document.getElementById("holyCow")</br>
document.body.firstChild</br>
document.body.children[0]</br></p>
<h1>Screen</h1>
<p>The window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:</br>

screen properties width and height are the full screen</br>

screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar</br>

The portion of a screen displaying the rendered document is the viewport in JavaScript, 
which is potentially confusing because we call an application's portion of the screen a window when talking about interactions with the operating system. 
The getBoundingClientRect() method of any document element will return an object with top, left, bottom, and right properties describing the location of the element in the viewport.</p>
